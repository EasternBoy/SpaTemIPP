# Distributed informative path planning of multiple mobile robots for spatio-temporal mapping

This code repository is for mapping spatio-temporal phenomena (STP) by multiple robots in a distributed manner.
Each robot has its own Gaussian Process model to capture STP. Here, we also consider the connectivity preserving mechanisms in the group of robots.
For more details, please find a manuscript from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16489.


Run MainSim.jl to execute the simulation of $M$ robots.
